[Squash](https://quixdb.github.io/) is an open source library for compressing data, and comes with a range of compression algorithms. ofxSquash is a C++ wrapper for that libary for use with openFrameworks and supports both simple and stream API's. 

Comprsesion algorithms
----------------------

Squash ships with plugin implementations for the following algorithms:

* brieflz
* brotli
* bsc
* bzip2
* copy (no compression)
* crush
* csc
* density
* doboz
* fari
* fastlz
* gipfeli
* heatshrink
* libdeflate
* lz4
* lzf
* lzg
* lzham
* lzjb
* lzma
* lzo
* miniz
* ms-compress
* ncompress
* pithy
* quicklz
* snappy
* wflz
* yalz77
* zlib-ng
* zlib
* zling
* zpaq
* zstd

There's a really helpful system at https://quixdb.github.io/squash-benchmark/ which can help you choose which algorithm to pick for your data.

Unsupported algorithms
----------------------

The following plugins do not work on these platforms:

### OSX

* csc
* ncompress
* quicklz

###Â Windows

* csc
* doboz
* pithy

Usage
=====

Basic API
---------

To get a list of available algorithms:

```c++
	auto codecs = ofxSquash::getCodecList();
	cout << "Squash found " << codecs.size() << " codecs." << endl;
	for(auto & codec : codecs) {
	  cout << "* " << codec.getName() << endl;
	}
```

Generally we use the class `ofxSquash::Codec` for most of our work, e.g.:

```c++
// create a Density codec object
auto codec = ofxSquash::Codec("density");

//make something to compress
string text = "Something to compress";

// compress the text using our codec
auto compressedText = codec.compress(text);

// uncompress the text again, resulting in our original string
auto uncompressedText = codec.uncompress(compressedText);
```

Stream API
----------

Often whilst we're compressing, we might not want to pass the entire data to the codec at once, for example:

* We're compressing from one file to another, and don't want to keep the entire contents in memory
* Latency is an issue, and we want the next process to begin before compression is completed (e.g. transmit to the network whilst compression is still ongoing).

Check exampleStreamSimple for help on how to use this (note you need to provide a lambda function to `ofxSquash::Stream`. This function is called whenever there is data available to write).

Compatability
=============

This addon is tested and working with :

* openFrameworks 0.9.0+
* Visual Studio 2015 x64 (Windows 10)
* XCode 7.2 x64 (OSX 10.11) 

Note : On OSX, the `ncompress` plugin doesn't work (causes a crash), so we generally remove it.

> Squash is licensed under the MIT License, which is highly permissive and allows Squash to be integrated into any application virtually without restriction. That said, please keep in mind that some plugins use libraries which are subject to more restrictive terms (such as the GNU GPL), and using Squash as an intermediary does not release you from the obligations of those licenses if you choose to actually use plugins which use those libraries. Squash includes an API for programmatically determining the license of a plugin, and it is possible to use it to avoid any GPL'd plugins even if they are installed. Each plugin's page in the C documentation lists the license of the library, or libraries, it uses.

> Several of the GPL libraries used by Squash plugins are also available for integration with proprietary software under commercial licenses.
